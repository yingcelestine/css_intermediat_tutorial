        Tory Brexit supporters alarmed by the prospect of a delay have hinted they could be won over in the coming
        weeks – if Theresa May can produce a serious concession from Brussels on the Irish backstop.

        The numbers may not be enough for May to win enough support for her deal, given continued opposition from a
        hardcore of Brexiters who also object to the £39bn financial settlement, those with personal grudges against
        the prime minister and Tory remainers hoping for a second referendum. However, some Brexiter MPs or those in
        seats which voted leave have suggested in recent days that there is a path to win their support.

        “There are clearly forces at work to block and frustrate Brexit and the most important thing, whether it’s good
        deal, no deal or whatever, is that we leave,” said Ben Bradley, the MP for Mansfield. “The public and leave
        voters will accept nothing less and that means that, yes, I will vote for a revised deal that doesn’t include a
        permanent backstop because, whilst I still have issues with it, those issues are then temporary and our leaving
        on 29 March is absolutely secured.”

        The Tory backbencher Andrew Murrison tabled an amendment to next Tuesday’s Brexit motion that insists on an
        expiry date to the backstop in the hope that it could allow MPs such as Bradley to demonstrate the level of
        parliamentary concern to both Downing Street and the EU.

        Downing Street said it would not comment on whether it would support Murrison’s amendment until it knew whether
        it had been selected by the Speaker for debate. No 10 is sympathetic in principle but it is not certain whether
        the EU would be antagonised by MPs demanding a time limit to the unpopular backstop.
