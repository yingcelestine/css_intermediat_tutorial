    <p>The Tory backbencher Andrew Murrison tabled an amendment to next Tuesday’s Brexit motion that insists on an
        expiry date to the backstop in the hope that it could allow MPs such as Bradley to demonstrate the level of
        parliamentary concern to both Downing Street and the EU.</p>

        The numbers <span id="middle">may not be enough </span>for May to win <span id="-10px">enough support for</span>
        her deal, given
        continued
        opposition from a
        hardcore <span id=super>of Brexiters who also object to the £39bn financial settlement,</span> those with
        personal

        the prime minister and Tory <span id="bottom">remainers hoping for a second referendum. </span>“There are

            deal, no deal or whatever, </span>is that we leave,” said Ben Bradley,
        the MP
        for Mansfield. “The public and leave
        voters will <span id="texttop">accept nothing less and that</span><span id="top"> means that, yes, I will
        </span>vote for a revised deal
        that
        doesn’t include a

        then
        temporary and our leaving
        on 29 March is absolutely secured.”

        Downing Street said it would not comment on whether it would support Murrison’s amendment until it knew whether
        it had been selected by the Speaker for debate. No 10 is sympathetic in principle but it is not certain whether
        the EU would be antagonised by MPs demanding a time limit to the unpopular backstop.
